Thoughts on Export Routine:

Requirements:
-Button operation that allows one or more settings to be imported and exported
-For exports, a single export script should be put on the user's desktop
-The script should be generated from the backend database not the front-end stored procedure calls
-The script should either contain values or calls to stored procedures, not raw SQL
